       "    'description': \"Establishment and Functional Responsibilities 1978-1985<br/><br/>The Department of Property and Services was formally created by Order-in-Council on 16 May 1978.  It was originally principally concerned with coordinating the provision of centralised services to other government agencies, the management of state elections, and the provision of information services to the public through a number of operational units, including the Victorian Government Printing Office (VA 1035), Government Computing Service (VA 1857), Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages (VA 983), Public Record Office (VA 683), State Electoral Office (VA 1061), Government Statist and Actuary (VA 989), and Government Courier Service (VA 1858). The Land Monitoring Division (VA 680) also operated within the Department until it was transferred to the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) in 1985.<br/><br/>In November 1981 the government information service and the government courier service were transferred to the Department from the Department of the Premier (VA 2717). Responsibility for government motor transport was also transferred from the Department of the Premier (VA 2717) in 1984.<br/><br/>Expansion of Responsibilities 1985<br/><br/>In 1985 following extensive machinery of government changes the Department was re-organised to enhance its role in relation to property and asset management, land identification and management, and land information services.  The Department assumed responsibility for the following operating units:<br/><br/>the Property and Services Division from the Public Works Department (VA 669)<br/><br/>the Titles Office and Registrar-General's Office (VA 862) from the Law Department (VA 864)<br/><br/>Land Information Services from the Law Department (VA 2825)<br/><br/>LANDATA from the Ministry of Planning and Environment (VA 1024)<br/><br/>the Surveyor-General's Office from the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034)<br/><br/>the Government Employee Housing Authority (VA 1356) from the Ministry of Housing (VA 609)<br/><br/>the Valuer-General's Office (VA 2322) from the Local Government Department (VA 601).<br/><br/>The transfer to the Department of these functions reflected the Government's decision to consolidate land information services and transactional land and property related functions into one Department, including:<br/><br/>providing leased and purchased accommodation suitable for occupation by government departments<br/><br/>administration of the Torrens system of land registration for dealings in land<br/><br/>creation of a state wide information system detailing all matters of land related data<br/><br/>survey and mapping<br/><br/>providing suitable housing accommodation for government employees<br/><br/>providing valuation advice to government agencies and local government authorities.<br/><br/>land monitoring.<br/><br/>From 1978/79 until 1985 the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) had responsibility for the function of monitoring government land sales. This function was inherited by the Treasurer in 1985 and was the responsibility of the Land Monitoring Division of the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) until it was transferred to the Department of Planning and Urban Growth (VA 3006) in early 1990. In 1991 the function was transferred back to the Department of the Treasury (VA 3007) and remained with this agency until it was transferred to the Department of Finance (VA 3016) after the October 1992 election. In mid 1993 responsibility for land monitoring was transferred to the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094).<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>All purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 or more require Land Monitoring approval to ensure that all Government requirements under the Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 in relation to property transactions are met. The function was established to provide Government with an independent safeguard against further land dealings of the type criticised at the Gowans Board of Enquiry and later at the Frost Royal Commission. This function is completely separate from the budgeting and planning functions in relation to government real estate. The function encompasses:<br/><br/>monitoring all purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 including assessing submissions from agencies and monitoring of auctions.<br/>the development of policies for the management of government real estate<br/>assisting in identifying properties that are surplus to current needs. Administering the Government's decision in relation to the disposal of surplus railway land<br/><br/>Landata<br/><br/>This function encompasses the development and provision of a comprehensive and co-ordinated electronic information network for quick access to data relating to any block of land in Victoria drawing on a variety of government agencies' records and information systems.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>Landata was established to co-ordinate the land information records and systems of various government agencies and to develop a computerised land information system for Victoria to provide ready access to information on each block of land in the State. In October 1982 a project team began developing a five year corporate plan for Landata, in conjunction with key user agencies. Responsibility for this function was transferred from the Department of Planning (VA 599) along with other planning functions in 1983. Landata became a division of the Ministry in January 1984.<br/><br/>In March 1985, following machinery of government changes, Landata was transferred to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) and grouped administratively with other major land information and land administration agencies within the Department, such as the Titles Office, the Division of Survey and Mapping and the Valuer-General's Office. Prior to this the Government Computing Service of the Department of Property and Services had provided the Landata Division with advice on technical specifications for computing equipment for the Landata system. In January 1991 this function was transferred to the Ministry of Finance (VA 3016).<br/><br/>Further Responsibilities from 1988<br/><br/>Following more machinery of government changes in 1988 the Department assumed responsibility for the following functions:<br/><br/>sale of Crown lands, particularly by public auction, from the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034)<br/><br/>supply of furniture, stores and equipment, fitting out government accommodation, maintenance of air-conditioning, and related survey and drafting functions for government constructions from the Ministry of Housing and Construction (VA 2907)<br/><br/>restraint and monitoring of prices, through the Office of Prices, following the transfer from the Department of Industry, Technology and Resources (VA 2661) of the Office of the Prices Commissioner and the Prices Peg Secretariat.<br/><br/>In September 1989 the Office of Prices was transferred again to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs (VA 1026).<br/><br/>The Department also provides administrative support to a number of small statutory authorities such as the:<br/><br/>Electoral Commission<br/>Surveyor's Board<br/>Municipal Valuation Fees Committee<br/>Public Records Advisory Council.<br/><br/>Abolition of the Department of Property and Services<br/><br/>Following significant machinery of government changes in January 1991, the Department of Property and Services was abolished and its functions transferred to the Ministry for the Arts (VA 1025), Department of the Treasury (VA 3007), the Attorney-General's Department (VA 2825), the Ministry for Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (VA 3015) and the Ministry of Finance (VA 3016).<br/><br/>Location of Records<br/><br/>See also List of Holdings 2nd edition, 1985, section 3.18.1.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'The State College of Victoria (SCV) was established under the provisions of the State College of Victoria Act 1972 (no. 8376), which was proclaimed on 30 June 1973. The SCV became the co-ordinating body for teacher education in Victoria.<br/><br/>The first teacher training colleges were established in the 1920s at Ballarat, Bendigo and Melbourne. In the 1950s and 1960s, further colleges were opened in Geelong, Toorak, Burwood, Coburg and Frankston. These colleges offered teacher education programs for general primary and secondary school teachers. Other colleges for training specialist secondary and technical teachers were also established.<br/><br/>The State College of Victoria was established as a federation of former Education Department Teacher Training Colleges, the Kindergarten Teachers College and the Catholic Education Colleges. Following its establishment, the teacher training institutions ceased to be under the direct control of the Education Department.<br/><br/>The primary role of SCV was to co-ordinate and develop teacher training in Victoria by:<br/>* co-ordinating and fostering the development of the teachers college system through a Senate and Academic Board<br/>* training teachers for the areas of pre-school, primary, secondary and technical education<br/>* providing opportunities for upgrading of qualification of experienced teachers<br/>* providing places for vocational courses closely associated with teacher education<br/>* awarding degrees and diplomas<br/><br/>In 1978, the Committee of Inquiry into Post-Secondary Education (Partridge Committee) recommended that both the State College of Victoria and the Victoria Institute of Colleges (VA 571) be discontinued. The Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC; VA721) was set up as a statutory authority under the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education Act 1978 (no. 9145). Following receipt of submissions in 1979 and discussions with interested bodies, VPSEC recommended to the Minister of Education that the separate administrations of the Victoria Institute of Colleges (VIC) and the State College of Victoria (SCV) be discontinued. Under the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education (Amendment) Act 1980 (No. 9424), VIC and SCV were abolished and their functions and assets were transferred to VPSEC.',\n",
